# Chess Engine

I am attempting to make a decent chess engine. To make said chess engine decent, it would have to run relatively fast. This is why I wanted to use c++ and also because I wanted to get better at it. I didn't want to make a gui in c++ as that would require learning an entire new skill, instead since I knew html,css,js and, most importantly, react, I decided to try to link those together. I used the cpp-httplib library and link them together.
